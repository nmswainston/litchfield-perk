## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18; Netlify builds use 20)
- npm (recommended) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmswainston/litchfield-perk.git
cd litchfield-perk
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

Tip (Windows): you can also double‚Äëclick `run-site.bat` to start the dev server.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

For Netlify deployment, ensure the following settings:

- Node version is set to `20` via `netlify.toml` `[build.environment]`
- SPA redirects and caching headers are configured in `netlify.toml`

## üîß Deployment Env Vars

No runtime env vars required. The application uses only standard build-time environment variables (NODE_ENV) which are automatically handled by the build system.

## üé® Design Features

- **Botanical Pattern Background**: Custom pattern that absorbs into the header on scroll
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion for elegant transitions
- **Color Scheme**: Friends-inspired green (#0B6534) with clean whites and grays
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React 19**: Modern React with hooks
- **Vite 5**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Instagram Widget**: Social media integration

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and optimized for:

- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Large screens (1200px+)

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `src/components/sections/`
2. Export it from `src/components/sections/index.js`
3. Import and use it in `src/app/LitchfieldPerkApp.jsx`

### Editing Menu Items

- Update categories and items in `src/data/menu.js` (`menuCategories`, `menuItems`).
- No JSX changes required; the `MenuSection` reads from this data source.

### Instagram Integration

- The Instagram section uses a SnapWidget embed. Replace the placeholder in `src/components/widgets/InstagramWidget.jsx` with your SnapWidget embed code.
- See `SNAPWIDGET_INTEGRATION.md` for step‚Äëby‚Äëstep instructions.

### Modifying the Header

The scroll header behavior can be customized in `src/components/layout/ScrollHeader.jsx`:

- Adjust `heroHeight` for different transition timing
- Modify `scrollProgress` thresholds for color changes
- Update botanical pattern opacity and blending

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with the official Vite and PostCSS integrations. Key customizations:

- Utility layers and base styles are defined in `src/index.css`
- Component-specific styles live alongside components
- Additional responsive image styles are in `src/styles/responsive-images.css`

See `TAILWIND_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` for performance tips.

### Analytics

Privacy‚Äëfirst analytics are supported via Plausible (enabled by default), with optional Fathom and GA4 (disabled by default). Configuration is in `src/utils/analytics.js`.

See `ANALYTICS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for setup instructions.
